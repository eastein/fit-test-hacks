<h1>Fit Test Assistant</h1>

<p style="color: red;">
    <strong>
    WARNING: this has not been tested much, it's "alpha" quality software and shouldn't be used yet for real fit tests you'll rely on for anything. The list of exercises is not finalized and it may be buggy.
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    This tool will tell you what to do both textually on screen and audibly (using Speech Synthesis in your browser) while you do the fit test. It will also keep time for you to ensure you do the right exercises for the right amount of time. It doesn't control a fit test machine. If you are using a Quantitative fit tester like a portacount, press start test on the machine and this web-page at the same moment to keep the directions and the machine's automatic exercise schedule synchronized.
